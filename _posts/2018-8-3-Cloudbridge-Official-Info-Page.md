### Team Overview
Cloudbridge is a very small and newly established team of only three member current members.  From being in the team for two weeks, my understating is that we are making chains of APIs which transfer data from old payroll systems, such as, Exo and Foxpro, and are storing them in a GDM (Generic Data Model).  This data is then going to be sent to our Advanced team so that customers can easily be transfered to our 'better written' software.

### Members:
#### - Erich Kuba (Senior Developer)
*"I can concentrate for 14 hours straight"*
Great guy.  He really knows his stuff and is an expert in most thing due to everything being a lot more difficult when he first started programming.  He has made big mistakes previously in his career and does not make mistakes anymore. He is really good at explaining concepts but usually chooses not to because I need to improve my self-learning ability.
#### - Ivan Karaman (Russian Hacker)
*"I blame microsoft"* (said a minimum of 3 times per day)
He is blatently honest about all his thoughts which is exactly what a good team needs. He is a logical thinker and has an impressive knowledge of memes.  He takes everything very literally and I recommend thinking about what you are going to say for 5 minutes before talking to him so you don't get out smarted.

#### - Jordan Elley (Temporary Member on Crew Rotations)
great worker.

### Technical Info
This team is completely back-end.  All of our code is written in Javascript with node 8.11.3. Jest is used for all of our tests.  Our test coverage is 100% where possible which makes the code easy to modify and refactor.  For our pipeline, all of our tools are from AWS.  (CodePipeling, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy).  Our applications are hosted in an Ubuntu ec2.

### Team Work
#### Stand ups
Our stand ups consist of three talkings points:
* what did we do yesterday 
* what are we doing today
* what is blocking us
They are very short as we work together all day and are already aware of each others problems.  Usually we have to explain the stuff to our manager.

#### Coding
Before I joined the team, they had pull requests disabled. This means that they did the majority of their code via pairing and merged straight to the main branch.  They do a lot of diagrams on the whiteboard and make sure they are both on the same page.  Since I have joined the team, Cloudbridge has been forced into enabling pull requests.  This means that we have started reviewing each others code.  I have mostly worked on API's for the team by myself but next week I will be working on a spike project with Ivan.  To indicate what tasks we are working on we use sticky notes on the board.  We have no retros or meetings besides stand ups.

This team is a very open-minded, intelligent team and are happy to embrace change and listen to my ideas.  I think the small style team works really well.
