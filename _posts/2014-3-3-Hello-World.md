Hey!  Here is my blog as a grad developer.

## Orientation

Us Aucklanders were really lucky. We got to go to Melbourne to be with the other graduates for orientation week.  We learned about the company and did a lot of origami.

The Cremorne office was pretty neat.  As you can see from the image, the staircase has binary on the side.

Here we have a exclusive photo of us Auckland proteges on the train.
