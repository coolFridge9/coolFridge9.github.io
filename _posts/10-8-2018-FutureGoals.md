My mentors want to see a blog about what I want to do when I grow up so here it is.  

### motivation and pathway into coding
Ill start by talking about my motivations. From when I was really young
(primary school) i wanted to be a video games developer.  I had no idea where to start and when asking my parents,
they didn't know but they gave me a Dreamweaver book, which I read, but I still had no idea how to make games.

In intermediate school/highschool I was really impressed with a games developement company called Naughty Dog 
and my dream was to work there.

Theres were alot of things that really impressed me about this company's ability to innovate.  For there first big hit (Crash
Bandicute). They invented a new gameplay angle where you view the character from behind rather than from the side like 
traditional games.  They also created a game on PS2 where you could go anywhere on their map without any loading screens. 
I thought it was cool that they had invented all these new algorithms that traditional developers hadn't thought of before 
and were able to achieve much better results.

The first games I made were on my calculator at school in basic.  You could specify the co-ordinates where thing were output on the screen.  I found this really cool and I spent a lot of time coming up with new formulas and algorithms on how I could make the game play smoother or add in more objectives and rewards systems.  I had also built many text-based games in java but I could never figure out the GUI frameworks available in Java enough for games.

When I was in Uni I started building games in unity (C#).  but I always had assignments to do and I stopped trying to become a games dev.  

### Future
For the last year or two, my goal has been to be the person who understands and designs the system but doesn't do most of the coding.  From my research, im pretty sure that fits the description of an architect.  A small part of me still wants to be a games developer but I don't know enough about the industry to know if I would actually enjoy it.
