title: Future Goals

My mentors want to see a blog about what I want to do when I grow up so here it is.  From when I was really young
(primary school) i wanted to be a video games developer.  I had no idea where to start and when asking my parents,
they didn't know but they gave me a Dreamweaver book, which I read, but I still had no idea how to make games.

In intermediate school/highschool I was really impressed with a games developement company called Naughty Dog 
and my dream was to work there.

Theres were alot of things that really impressed me about this company's ability to inovate.  For there first big hit (Crash
Bandicute). They invented a new gameplay angle where you view the character from behind rather than from the side like 
traditional games.  They also created a game on PS2 where you could go anywhere on their map without any loading screens. 
I thought it was cool that they had invented all these new algorithms that traditional developers hadn't thought of before 
and were able to achieve much better results.
