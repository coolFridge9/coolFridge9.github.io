## First Day in a Crew

I joined the CloudBridge team on Friday for the day.  They were working on tranfering data from old payroll systems onto
the more modern payroll systems.  

They were working on using a new technology which would output an informative alert when a data entry is changed.

### procedure
This was an experiment day for the team so they put a time box on proving that this piece of technology would work. 
They timeboxed the experiement to one day so if the couldnt get it to work after a day we would scrap it and write it ourself.
Fortunatly we did get it working so the day wasn't wasted.

### Team Work
Fortunately the crew I joined only had two people so it was really easy to join.  They usually pair with one driver and 
one navigator.  With me in the crew, We mobbed with one driver and two navigators.  We rotated roles every 10 minutes so
that everyone had a turn of driving frequently. They frequently discussed how/why they were coding something in a particular 
way.

### Standup
Since the two in the team talk to each other all day, their stand up was used to report and justify their work to their manager.

### How did I feel
I understood what we were doing overall but I couldn't have written any code for the project on my own.  At times I felt a bit lost but I didn't want to hold up the experiment for too long so I didn't always ask enough questions to get it.
