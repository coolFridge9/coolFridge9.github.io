## First Day in a Crew

I joined the CloudBridge team on Friday for the day.  They were working on tranfering data from old payroll systems onto
the more modern payroll systems.  

They were working on using a new technology which would output an informative alert when a data entry is changed.

### proceedure
This was an experiment day for the team so they put a time box on proving that this piece of technology would work. 
They timeboxed the experiement to one day so if the couldnt get it to work after a day we would scrap it and write it ourself.
Fortunatly we did get it working so the day wasn't wasted.

### Conventions followed
Fortunately the crew I joined only had two people so it was really easy to join.  They usually pair with one driver and 
one navigator.  With me in the crew, We mobbed with one driver and two navigators.  We rotated roles every 10 minutes so
that everyone had a turn of driving frequently.
